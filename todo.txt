Done:
using my own finite field implementation, dont need pyerase for the field anymore 
generating plots with error rates for different field sizes
monte carlo simulation of error rates for all fields

TODO: 
compare error rates, when swapping

implementing rref
implementing ACR
implementing combined recovery
pollution security check for different fields
