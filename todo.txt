Stand 11.02.2026

Done:
using my own finite field implementation, dont need pyerase for the field anymore 
generating plots with error rates for different field sizes
monte carlo simulation of error rates for all fields

27.02: simple recoding done, orthogonality stays intact 
28.02: started rref implementation, added base functions like inverse that will be necessary

TODO: 
monte carlo test with recoding

implement swap / other means of preventing the 0 error tag

compare error rates, when swapping

implementing rref
implementing ARC
-> implementing combined recovery


pollution security check for different fields

Later:



optimize performance 
    Python's built-in ctypes module
    Cython: Write Python-like code 
    CPython Extensions: Pure C API
